**TalentFinder** is an application designed to match project managers (Finders) and auditioners (Creators). These roles are not mutually exclusive, meaning users can decide 
to create projects or join them. Users will either login or register at the start of the app and then navigate to the Home screen, where they can view a list of projects to 
participate in or create a project. This application will use the Facebook SDK to allow users to connect their Facebook profiles to their application profiles.
